## Dataset Components

The English Word Atlas dataset combines materials from multiple sources with different licenses:

- **Roget's Thesaurus (1911, 15a edition)**: Public Domain
- **Ogden's Basic English**: Public Domain
- **Swadesh List**: Public Domain
- **General Service List (GSL)**: Public Domain
- **New General Service List v1.2 (NGSL)**: CC BY-SA 4.0
- **NLTK Resources**: Apache License 2.0

The most restrictive license among these components is the Apache License 2.0, which is why this 
entire dataset is released under that license.

## Third-Party Components

This software includes components from other projects that may have different licenses:

- **Sentence Transformers/ALL-MiniLM-L6-v2**: Apache License 2.0

All rights to the original works belong to their respective owners.
